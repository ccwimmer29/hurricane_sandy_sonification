## Overview

This project explores the intersection of **music, data science, and environmental storytelling** through **data sonification**. Using real meteorological data from NOAA collected during Hurricane Sandy's landfall in New Jersey in October 2012, I translated environmental data into music â€” creating a soundscape that reflects both the beauty and devastation of natureâ€™s power.

This project is deeply personal to me: growing up 10 minutes from the Jersey Shore, I witnessed firsthand the destruction Hurricane Sandy brought to my community. Although my family and home were fortunate, seeing the devastation across friends' houses and the shore towns I loved left a lasting impact. Through this project, I wanted to capture that emotional and environmental memory in a new form.

## Inspiration

This project was inspired by my undergraduate course **"Music and Environment"**, which explored how composers have historically imagined and engaged with the natural world. In particular, I was influenced by the work of **John Luther Adams** â€” especially his pieces *Become Ocean* and his data-driven installation *The Place Where You Go to Listen*. Adams' blending of art, science, and environmental awareness resonated deeply with me and motivated me to create my own project at the intersection of these fields.

In this course, we explored:
- **Listening to the Environment** (deep listening, soundwalks)
- **Representing the Environment** (translating natural phenomena into sound)
- **Speaking for the Environment** (using music as environmental activism)

My project is a small continuation of this tradition: representing nature through sound, while reflecting on both its beauty and its immense, sometimes destructive, power.

## Methodology

- **Data Source**: NOAA data from Sandy Hook, NJ station, collected every 6 minutes on October 28â€“29, 2012.  
  - Variables: Verified Water Levels, Wind Speed, Wind Gusts, Pressure

    - *Notice the abrupt termination of data collection after the wind gust reached 60 knotsðŸ˜³*

- **Processing Steps**:
  - Wrote a custom Python program to **map** each data variable to **MIDI notes** in the **E minor scale** (chosen for its somber, reflective tone).
  - Imported the generated MIDI tracks into **Logic Pro X** (Digital Audio Workstation).
  - Assigned instruments to different data streams (e.g., strings for water level, brass for wind gusts).
  - Added basic mixing and mastering effects (EQ, delay, reverb) to enhance emotional depth and clarity.

## Future Directions

This project ignited a strong interest in **data sonification** for me. I plan to continue exploring how **scientific data** â€” from weather events to climate change indicators â€” can be transformed into musical narratives that engage, inform, and move listeners.  
Ultimately, I believe **art and science** can together inspire deeper connections to our environment and to one another.

## Personal Note

Music gives us another language to speak about our world â€” one that is emotional, intuitive, and human. This project is a small attempt to listen to nature differently, and to honor the resilience of both the natural world and the communities it shapes.
